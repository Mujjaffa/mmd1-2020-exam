            We created BLUEREEF after learning how much pollution, our oceans are going through. We learned that our oceans are dying and creating a big problem for not only us, but the whole eco-system of the ocean, millions of lives and plants are disappearing
            every day, without people knowing. We realized that it is because people are uninformed, but most importantly is that they can’t relate to the problem and that creates an ignorant audience. We have therefore created this website, not only
            to inform people, but make them relate and show them how everybody can make a difference by change simple acts from their everyday life.
